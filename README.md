## Garage freeze

To prevent any problem with my water pipes in my garage when it's too cold outside, these pipes can be heated.

Hardware:
- heat resistors on the pipes
- resistors are pluged on smartplugs
- temperature sensor for outside temperature (for me a software sensor given by Meteo France)

## Home alarm

Basic geofing given by my alarm system cannot handle some specific cases to me: I have an isolated room where when I'm in I want my alarm system to be armed, I have a specific profile for night etc.
