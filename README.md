## Garage freeze

To prevent any problem with my water pipes in my garage when it's too cold outside, these pipes can be heated.

Hardware:
- heat resistors on the pipes
- resistors are pluged on smartplugs
- temperature sensor for outside temperature (for me a software sensor given by Meteo France)

## Heating isolated room

I have isolated room in my house, with it's own heating system (heater plugged with a smartplug). This handle heating in isolated room, based on a reference climate and other custom rules.

## Home alarm

Basic geofing given by my alarm system cannot handle some specific cases to me: I have an isolated room where when I'm in I want my alarm system to be armed, I have a specific profile for night etc.

## Home heating

Generaly, Tado geofincing works great, but I have a particular case: I have an isolated room, with its own heating system, and when I'm in this room and alone at home, I want my global home heating to be set on away, to prevent heating the whole home for nothing.

## Presence in room

Set presence in a room based on different sensors.
